# AJAX Basics

## AJAX Concepts

Introduction to AJAX

- AJAX web pages ask for info from the server: Async JavaScript and XML
- JS processes the data to change the web page
- Request: Asking server for data
- Response: Answer by server with data
- In console you can see the ajax requests: control click and choose: 'Log XMLHttpRequests' that tell you the logging of your scrolling/page
- Don't waste users time with unnecessary web page refreshes

How AJAX works

- Server signup example
- XMLHttpRequest Object is being sent back and for
- what AJAX stands for: Async JavaScript And XML
- Four steps to creating and sending a XHR request:
    - Create and XMLHTTP Request (XHR) Object: tells browser to get ready, get everything together to create the object to send and receive later
    - Create a callback function: Programming to run when server returns its response, update the HTML on the page (update the map on google maps)
    - Open a request: Give browser (method: get or post), url where method is sent to.
    - Send the request: send from browser to webserver
