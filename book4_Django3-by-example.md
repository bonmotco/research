# 2020-Django 3 by Example

Date: June 18, 2020

Today I learnt:

1. Install Django and learn that a venv is necessary to run a Django project. Activate it by: my_venv/bin/activate; deactivate by 'deactivate'.
2. Learning about the different use of files and folders in a new django project. Learn that apps are part of a Django project.
3. Creating a blog data scheme for the blog app looks like setting up a SQL query. SQLite is integrated since Python 3.3.
4. Creating the admin and the default name is my computer name: sebastian.
5. Querying works just like using a SQL tool.

Stopped at page 25 this morning but have to continue until page 39.
